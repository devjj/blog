# About

Welcome to my personal website. This is a federated blog that automatically syndicates content to:

- **The Fediverse** via ActivityPub (powered by Bridgy Fed)
- **Bluesky** via the AT Protocol

## Technical Details

This site is built with:
- [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/) - A modern static site generator
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - For hosting and continuous deployment
- [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/) - For ActivityPub federation
- Custom Ruby functions for AT Protocol integration

The entire site is static and requires no database or server-side runtime.
